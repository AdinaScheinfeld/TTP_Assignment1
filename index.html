        <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>

        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. <br>
            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory 
            illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br> 
            Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
            chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
