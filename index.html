            <p>
                We implore upon every individual and community in the country to join us to demand that our leaders take
                 action to end <br>gun violence in our schools and to protect our students.  Unfortunately, the United States 
                 is one of the few countries in the <br>world where mass-shootings in schools are commonplace. 
                Instead of preparing for the consequences of mass shootings<br> in schools, we must work to prevent them This 
                problem can be solved!
